# Getting Started

Below you will find everything you need to get this project installed and
running, as well as any nuances that you may need to be aware of for running
this project.

---

## Installation

Please check the official
[Laravel 10 documentation](laravel-docs) for an installation
guide with the server requirements before you get started.

Alternatively, you can use the [Laravel Sail Docker containerization](#docker)
support to run the project, instead of relying on local dependencies. Please
check the official
[Laravel Sail documentation](sail-docs).

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:btrsco/anymoji.git
```

Switch to the repo folder:

```shell
cd project
```

Install all the composer and npm dependencies:

```shell
composer install
npm install
```

Copy the `.env.example` and generate a new application key:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Run the database migrations **(Set the database connection in .env before
migrating)**:

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

Build the frontend assets, this will also build the SSR assets:

```shell
npm run build
```

You can now run the SSR server:

```shell
php artisan inertia:start-ssr
```

## Database Seeding

Populate the database with seed data with relationships. This can help you to
quickly start testing the application and/or api with realistic data.

Run the database seeder:

```shell
php artisan db:seed
```

This will run the base `/database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` which has a list
of universal, development and production seeders. Comment out the seeders you
donâ€™t need to run.

**Note**: It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can
refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the
following command:

```shell
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Docker

You can use [Laravel Sail](sail-docs) to run the project in a Docker container.
Unfortunately, Laravel Valet conflicts with Laravel Sail, so you will need to
stop Valet before running Sail.

Run the following command to start the container:

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

# Code Overview

Laravel best practices and has been optimized to be as simple as possible. If
you are not familiar with some terms used below, you can read more about them
in the [Laravel 10 documentation](laravel-docs) or the
specific documentation for the dependencies listed below.
